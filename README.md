# Description
Even you are a Data Scientist or a Blockchain developer, you need to have frontend skills for your application to be consumed by end users and [react](https://reactjs.org/) is the suitable framework for this job ([nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) is on my list). And most importantly deploying an application to production which I consider a huge step forward for me.

The purpose of this repository is to build a simple react application using Test-Driven Development, Taking advantage of the following technologies. 
  *  github platform and [github action](https://github.com/features/actions) feature to apply simple DevOps stuff.
  *  [vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy the application to a ```preview environment``` following each commit and a ```production environment``` following the merging of every pull request.
  *  [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) an e2e testing framework that helps us applying our TDD approach.

# Setup
  clone the repo and run the following command. 
  ```
  cd app && npm i
  ```
  
# Usage
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  
# Metrics
  Vercel uses metrics to evaluate and monitor the health of our application. Here are the metrics for our application.
